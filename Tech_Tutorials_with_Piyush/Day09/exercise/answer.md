## 📌 Objectives

1. Create a Deployment and expose it using a **ClusterIP** Service.
2. Test internal accessibility via a BusyBox Pod.
3. Change the Service to **NodePort** and test external access.
4. Learn and reflect on when to use each service type.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### ✅ 1. Create a Deployment

```yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.23.4-alpine
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

---

### ✅ 2. Create a ClusterIP Service

```yaml
# service-clusterip.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service-clusterip.yaml
```

---

### ✅ 3. Scale the Deployment to 2 Replicas

```bash
kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=2
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=myapp
```

---

### ✅ 4. Create a BusyBox Pod and Test Internal Access

```bash
kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --restart=Never -it -- wget -O- myapp
```

You should see the default Nginx welcome page printed in the terminal.

---

### ❌ 5. Try Accessing the Service from Outside (ClusterIP Only)

This **will not work**:

```bash
wget http://<NodeIP>:<some-port>
```

`ClusterIP` only works **inside the cluster**.

---

### 🔁 6. Change the Service Type to NodePort

```yaml
# service-nodeport.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service-nodeport.yaml
```

---

### 🌍 7. Test from Outside the Cluster

```bash
wget http://<NodeIP>:30080
```

> Replace `<NodeIP>` with your Kubernetes node’s IP address (e.g., `minikube ip`).

You should now see the Nginx welcome page.

## 🤔 Discussions

### 💬 Q8: Can you expose Pods as a service without a deployment?

Yes, you can expose individual Pods using a Service **without a Deployment**, by using **label selectors**.
However, this is **not recommended** in production because:

* Pods may die and not restart.
* No automatic scaling or updates.

A **Deployment** ensures high availability, rollout, and self-healing of Pods.

---

### 💬 Q9: When to Use Each Service Type?

| Service Type | When to Use                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ClusterIP    | Default; internal service-to-service communication                  |
| NodePort     | Simple external access (non-cloud environments, dev/testing)        |
| LoadBalancer | Public-facing access in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)        |
| ExternalName | Connect to external services by DNS name (e.g., external DB or API) |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* `ClusterIP` is the default service type — perfect for internal access.
* `NodePort` exposes services externally, but opens a static port on every node.
* Use `LoadBalancer` for production-ready, cloud-friendly public access.
* Use `Ingress` (not part of this task) for more advanced routing + TLS.

## 📝 Blog Post / Social Media Update

I just completed Day 9 of #40daysofkubernetes! 🎉
Today I explored the differences between Kubernetes service types: `ClusterIP` vs `NodePort`.
💡 I learned that `ClusterIP` is great for internal-only access, while `NodePort` is useful for basic external access without a load balancer.
